# Executor
Simply, in your executor, put in:
```
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/copykites/store/refs/heads/main/roblox/INPUT_OVERLAY/init.lua"))()
```

*If you want to hide/show the input overlay*, press the **KeypadNumberFour** on your keyboard.

# Is it safe/allowed?
*Yes*, I think **this does not break the roblox ToS rules**.

It only puts in some UIs, it *does not modify the game*.
(only your executor does)

And *this script does not inject viruses* into your computer,
I don't even know how malicious scripts do that.
